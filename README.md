# Formula

Formula project includes two files - SQL file and a Python file.

### About the Project

First, I designed a database that includes information about formula, a total of 10 tables (details about the drivers, cars, sponsers and more) and 
I designed the database for 2 types of system users who are fans and league administrators.
Then I wanted to write complex queries to analyze data for the users of the database (for example: Displays the details of the drivers and the name of their car according to the total cumulative points they obtained in the round).
Finally, I made a gui to make the data more convenient to the eye.
