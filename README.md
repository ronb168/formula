# Formula

Formula project includes two files - SQL file and a Python file.

### About the Project

First, I designed a database that includes information about formula, a total of 10 tables (details about the drivers, cars, sponsors, and more) and I designed the database for 2 types of system users who are fans and league administrators. Then I wanted to write complex queries to analyze data for the users of the database (for example displays the details of the drivers and the name of their car according to the total cumulative points they obtained in the round). Finally, I made a GUI for making the data more convenient to the eye.
